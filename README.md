Firenâ€™t is an integrated information portal that aims to detect and measure the impact generated by forest fires around the world, in addition to presenting useful information to the populations of the area. All this is done in order for the tool to be used by authorities around the world in order to streamline mitigation and evacuation procedures for populations near forest fires, in addition to presenting information regarding the economic impact of forest fires .

## Develop

In the first instance, the data provided by all the satellites in the FIRMS database are used, and with these we proceed to make a cleaning of the information where the data is eliminated with a low confidentiality rate, after this is applied a clustering algorithm (mean shift clustering) which aims to find the sets of points that present a high density of hot spots per unit area, and with the groups found, we proceed to estimate the area of action of the detected fire, and With this estimate of the affected area, we proceed to estimate the costs associated with its mitigation in addition to the economic losses caused by this, finally we proceed to find the cities near the detected fire to notify the nearby communities.
